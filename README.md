# Alzheimer-stages-classifier

This repository includes the construction of a CNN model that can classify the degree of dementia using MRI brain scans from patients with Alzheimer's Disease. (Data from: https://www.kaggle.com/tourist55/alzheimers-dataset-4-class-of-images) The CNN is built using TensorFlow's Keras in google colab.

In addition, a web application is developed, which includes some scientific introduction on Alzheimer's disease and a portal for users to upload MRI images for classfication. It will classify it as one of the four stages (No dementia, very mild dementia, mild dementia, and moderate dementia) and offer a probability breakdown.

This is a final project for Beaver Works Summer Institute (BWSI 2020), course Medlytics.
